            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>Al-Karak Castle is located in the city of Al-Karak, Jordan, approximately 140 km south of Amman and 30 km north of Petra.</p>
            
            <h3>Why I Chose This Landmark</h3>
            <p>I chose Al Karak Castle because it's one of the largest & best-preserved Crusader castles in the Levant, it played a key role in Saladin’s conquests (Battle of Hattin, 1187) and it has massive walls, secret tunnels, and dark dungeons to explore.</p>
